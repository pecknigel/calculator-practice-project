# Tasks

A list of tasks to complete.

## Core Functionality

## Button Shape Options

An option to have round or square buttons.

Suggested Implementation: Have a class on the container that switches the buttons between square or round. Provide a button or switch to toggle it. Use `border-radius: 50%` to achieve the round button effect.

## Theme Options

Provide options for changing the colour scheme of the calculator.

Suggested Implementation: Have a class on the container that sets the colour scheme. Theme classes should only change the properties needed for the theming, and not duplicate any other declarations.

## Dark Mode

## Persist User Options
