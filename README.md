# Calculator Practice Project

This repository is provided for students looking to work on a simple calculator web application as a practice project.

View the code [using GitHub Preview](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pecknigel/calculator-practice-project/refs/heads/main/index.html).

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

If you’re looking to start simple, it can be best to just do HTML and CSS.

This project may not be ideal for that, since the HTML and CSS are provided.

However, looking over them can be a good way to learn, so perhaps start there.

## How it Looks

This is how it looks before you get started.

## How it Works

The HTML and CSS are provided so that you can get straight in to the [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Browser APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) (most notably [The DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)).

Open up the `script.js` or replace it with `script-with-structure.js` if you’d prefer some structure to work to.
