# Calculator Practice Project

This code is provided for students looking to work on a simple calculator web application as a practice project, written without any JavaScript frameworks (Vanilla JS).

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

If youâ€™re looking to start simple, it can be best to just do HTML and CSS.

This project may not be ideal for that, since the HTML and CSS are provided.

However, looking over them can be a good way to learn, so perhaps start there.
